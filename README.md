## Welcome to the Cockroach Labs Interview Process

You’ve heard it before folks. The interview process is broken. So what are companies doing to fix it? At Cockroach Labs, we are exploring new ways to structure our interview process. Instead of focusing on behavioral questions based on past performance or situational questions based on hypothetical future situations, we focus on exercise based interviews with an emphasis on applied skills required for the role. 

**Why are we open sourcing the interview process?**

* **To encourage recruiting professionals, founders, and anyone else to think outside the box regarding their interview process.** What else can we be doing to provide candidates with a process that is fair and inclusive?

* **To help candidates to come prepared!** If candidates take the time to research the questions and comes onsite ready to have an engaged discussion, we will be thrilled.

* **To collaborate.** The process is broken, let’s fix it *together. *Let’s all pledge to do better than we have before. We welcome feedback on our process and encourage candidates and recruiting professionals to contribute exercises as well.

Learn more by reading our blog post, ‘[Exercise Based Interviewing at Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/exercise-based-interviewing/).’

## Getting Started

The following content will provide both candidates and recruiters with valuable information. 

**For candidates**

* You will leave with a thorough understanding of the interview process at Cockroach Labs, along with visibility into real questions from our onsite interviews. Our recruiters will be happy to confirm which of these questions will be presented during the onsite interview. 

* Please note, around 10% of each interview is spent on a curve-ball that we do not include in the exercises below. While you can come prepared for a majority of the interview, we also like to see how candidates think on their toes.

**For recruiters**

* Leverage the Cockroach Labs interview process and questions for your company’s hiring needs. If you would like access to the curve-ball questions, please reach out direct to [Contact], and we will be happy to share them with you.

* Contributions to the Cockroach Labs Interview Process are welcomed and encouraged! Please see Contributing to the Interview Process Guide [TBC]. If you have created exercises for a new department, please request that this department is added so you can create a branch/fork [Don’t know if this is necessary]. 

## Interview Process and Timeline

Overview:

image removed by export

A candidate should expect to wait 3-5 business days between each step of the process. At any point throughout the process, the candidate can reach out to the recruiter with any questions or an update on their candidacy. 

1. **Candidate Application:** Applicants automatically receive confirmation of their application, thanking them for submitting their information. This is an automated message from the Applicant Tracking System (in this case, Greenhouse).

2. **Candidate Application Review:** The recruiter for the position will do the first round of evaluations. If more information is required, a member of the team will reach out to the applicant directly to request it. Disqualified candidates will be sent an email informing them of the rejection. 

3. **Recruiter Phone Screen:** If the candidate qualifies, the recruiter will send a confirmation for a 30-minute call to explore the candidate’s background and experience. Depending on the outcome of the screening call, the recruiter will either reject the candidate or move them to the next stage in the process. The candidate will either proceed to a take-home exercise or a technical phone interview. Please note, the candidate’s resume and the recruiter’s notes from the pre-screen are not shared with the hiring team. Learn more about this here: "[How We're Fighting Unconscious Bias](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/fighting-unconscious-bias-cockroach-labs/)."

4. **Phone Interview and/or Take-home Exercise**

    1. **Phone interview:** The 1-hour phone interview with a member from the team covering skills related to the role. For technical phone interviews, we use Google Hangouts and [coderpad.io](http://coderpad.io/), covering coding, data structures, and algorithms (i.e., Big-O Notation).

    2. **Take-home Exercise:** Typically taking 1-2 hours to complete, the take-home exercise allows for the hiring manager to review a candidate’s output of skills directly related to the position before proceeding to the onsite interview. The take-home exercise replaces one phone interview and one onsite interview, equaling two hours of engagement.  

5. **In-person interviews:** Next steps in the process are an onsite interviews. The onsite interview team consists of members from the company that a candidate will work with. We limit the onsite interview to 4-5 exercise based interviews and 1 lunch. The interviews could include people on the direct team or cross teams. The lunch is time for a candidate to relax and ask questions to learn more about Cockroach Labs and get a feel for our culture. The recruiter will share an overview of who the candidate will be meeting before the onsite interview. 

6. **Hiring Committee Review:** After the onsite interview is complete, feedback from the interview process is shared across the interview team, including the candidate’s resume and recruiter’s prescreen notes. Interview team members review the feedback and independently reach a decision of hire/no-hire based on the comprehensive feedback before the HC Review. At the HC review, the interview team reaches a consensus of if they would like to proceed with or reject the candidate.  

7. **Reference calls:** The staffing team will make reference calls for promising candidates. At a minimum, two reference calls should be completed - preferring at least one to be a manager or someone who has worked directly with the candidate and can speak to their work. 

8. **Final Review:** After reference calls are completed successfully, the recruiter submits the employee packet to the CEO and Hiring Manager for approval.

9. **Offer Extend:** The recruiter will reach out to schedule time to connect with the candidate to extend the candidate the offer. Initially, this is done verbally but is always followed by the written offer as described in the section on preparing offers. The Hiring Manager and interview team follows-up to answer any questions that the candidate may have, which will hopefully, lead to the candidate accepting the offer. 

10. **Offer Accept/Onboarding:** If the candidate accepts the offer, the onboarding process begins.

## For Recruiters - Resources

These files provide a deep-dive into the various stages of the interview process. It is important that recruiters tailor each stage to the position they are hiring for. Stages included: 

* Recruiter Phone Screen

* Structuring the Interview

* Interview Feedback and Scoring

* Rejecting Applicants

### [File] Recruiter Phone Screen

We conduct recruiter phone screens for all positions. The phone screens typically take around 30 minutes and are conducted by the recruiter responsible for the position. 

At the beginning of the phone screen, the recruiter will let the candidate know that they will be starting the phone screen by learning more about the candidate’s background and experience; then giving the candidate an overview of the company, position, and process; and lastly, wrapping up the call with any questions the candidate may have. 

**Typical recruiter phone screen questions:**

1. Overview of work experience, current and past (i.e., What you do? Where have you worked? Professional accomplishments? What are your primary responsibilities? What is the rest of your time spent on? etc.)

2. What is the largest or most impactful project you have worked on? What was the structure of the team? What was your responsibility?

3. Do you have any side projects that you are working on? (e.g., Github contributions, etc.)

4. What sparked your interest in Cockroach Labs? What motivated your job search?

5. Do you have any time constraints (offers expected, vacations planned, etc.)? Are you interviewing with other companies? If yes, at what step of the process are you in?

6. Confirm any salary expectations.

7. Confirm education.

8. Are you eligible to work in the U.S.?

The questions above will vary on the role the candidate is being considered for. These questions are determined with the Hiring Manager during the kick-off meeting for the position. 

It’s important to note that compensation is discussed at start and end of the process but not in between. Compensation expectations are asked about during the recruiter phone screen. If expectations seem misaligned based on what is approved for the role, the recruiter will let the candidate know. Being a startup, we sometimes can not meet the expectations that a candidate may have. If expectations are aligned, then the topic of compensation does not resurface until an offer is extended. 

At the end of the phone screen, the candidate will have a good understanding of the company, the role, timeline, and next steps. When still calibrating on a position, the recruiter will review the candidate’s pre-screen notes and resume before determining next steps. 

### [File] Structuring the Interview

#### Before the interview

* While the candidate is expected to review all resources available to prepare for the interview, our interviewers need to also prepare. We expect our interviewers to be clear on the skills required for the position. 

* Although the resume is not included for the interviewer, the level of the candidate is available in the public notes. This will indicate the years of experience that the candidate has in the industry. 

* The interviewer will also come prepared with a question strategy and approach to get data to assess the candidate’s fit for the position. For technical interviews, this includes coding, data structures, algorithms and system design. 

#### During the interview

1. It’s important to remember that interviews are not natural and it’s normal not to feel comfortable. There is an unbalanced power relationship during the interview. The interviewer is in a power position, deciding who receives an offer and who does not. At Cockroach Labs, we strive to be as friendly and open as we can, setting clear expectations. As the candidate, you can expect the following structure to be used: 

* Opening (5%) - Build trust and rapport, establish a positive climate, structure the interview

    * Greeting - Let them know who you are and what you do at Cockroach Labs! 

    * Stage Setter - Provide a framework to the interview: "We are going to go through a series of questions and at the end, I’ll provide you with some time to ask questions to me."

    * Any other relevant information to put the candidate at ease.

* Interview Question (75/90%)

    * Varies on the type of interview you are conducting. Please see specific Interview Guides for breakdowns.

* Close (5%) - Candidate Questions

2. Communication is really hard in an interview setting. Candidates need to allow the interviewer to consistently hear their thought process. The interviewers will provide prompts to help the candidate through questions if they get stumped. Our objective is not to challenge a candidate to the point of discomfort, rather, open up their mind to learn about how they solve problems.  

3. We do not strive to assess perfect theoretical knowledge that the candidate can google when needed, or give a problem that took you 2 months to dominate yet you expect your interviewee to master in a 30 minutes conversation.

4. Come prepared. If you haven’t been interviewing, run through a couple of questions with your friends so you will get back to the mentality of what it feels like to answer interview question. 

5. Come with questions! The interviewer leaves time at the end of the interview to ask questions so please come with them and we will be prepared to answer as thoroughly as we can. 

### [File] Interview Feedback and Scoring

After an interview with a candidate, the interviewer will always leave feedback. The goal of collecting feedback is to answer the question, "Would I want this person on my team?" 

At Cockroach Labs, we use a 4 point scale:

* 4.0   Strong Hire - I feel strongly that this person will be successful in this role and am ready to present arguments why.

* 3.0   Hire - I am inclined toward believing this person will perform well in this role.

* 2.0   No Hire - I generally believe this candidate will perform poorly in this role but could be convinced otherwise.

* 1.0   Strong No Hire - I strongly believe the candidate will be a poor performer in this role. 

In the interview feedback, the interviewer is asked to include general impressions, a brief description on what have experienced during interviews, where the interviewer stands and why they have this prospective. 

### [File] Rejecting applicants

1. At any time during the hiring process the candidate can be rejected or they can withdraw from the process.

2. The applicant will always be notified if they are rejected. The recruiter is primarily responsible for declining candidates. 

3. If the candidate asks for further feedback, the feedback will always be related to the job requirements. If a candidate is rejected from the process, we ask that a candidate reflects on the requirements for the role and the interview process to see where they may still have some room to grow. 

4. It is important to remember that Cockroach Lab is still very small so the requirements are very specific and the expectations for the roles are high. Our main objective is to guarantee the success of the candidate if they are hired. If we feel there is any misalignment with the role, even minor, we will reject the candidate from the process. 

5. The recruiter will send out an inquiry to all candidates who come onsite to gather feedback after they have exited the hiring process. The feedback is sent out within 2 days after the applicant has been notified of the rejection or hire. People Ops will review all feedback and use it to improve the hiring process.

## Challenging our Unconscious Bias

In the effort of building a diverse workforce, at Cockroach Labs, we ask the question "are we missing strong candidates because of preconceptions or the unconscious biases of the interviewer?" To challenge our bias, we have taken two actions:

1. Exercise based interviewing

2. Removing resumes

Our hypothesis is that a structured and fair process means better decisions. Eliminating all bias or complete anonymity is not the goal. 

## Exercise Based Interview Questions

The purpose of an interview is to obtain information about a candidate required to predict future performance. To accomplish this purpose, we rely on Exercise-Based Interviewing. Exercise based interviews can include case studies, group exercises involving role play or discussions, individual exercises, or presentations. They allow for our interviewers to witness the direct application of a candidate’s abilities to competencies required for the role. Rather than guess if a candidate can do the job based on their answers to behavioral questions, we ask for candidates to show. During the interview, candidates are asked to complete exercises that are similar to the initiatives they would complete when actually working in the position on a day to day basis.

For engineering positions, we use coding and system design questions. For non-tech, we use job-based simulations through the form of case studies, individual exercises, and/or presentations. We are not currently open sourcing our technical interview questions, however, the following are some examples of what to expect when going through the interview process with Cockroach Labs:

1. Median Data Structure: Develop a data structure that is better than this "brute force" median computation. The data structure needs to support insert, delete and retrieval of the median.

2. Regex engine: Implement a subset of regex matching

3. Minimum snippet window: Given K sets of integers, find the minimum interval containing one from each set

For more information about the different exercises we use in our interview process, please review the different department areas.
